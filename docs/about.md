# History/Justification

I love Draw.io! Compared to expensive and heavy commercial options like Visio and Miro, Draw.io's free and lightweight app allows wider and more universal distribution of diagrams. Because the files are stored in plaintext they can be versioned alongside code in a repository as documentation. The XML-based file format makes these diagrams semi-portable, and could easily be ported to other applications if Draw.io ever failed you. For these reason, I think it's one of the best options for documentation diagrams.

When I had a need to generate heirarchical tree diagrams of requirement structures I was surprised to find there wasn't even a single existing Python library for working with these files. I took the project home and spent a weekend building the initial functionality. I've been adding functionality, robustness, and documentation intermittently since.
